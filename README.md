##  Project - 1
##  EDA & Data Preprocessing on Google App Store Rating Dataset.
### Domain: Mobile device apps
- Context: The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. However, many
           apps are being developed every single day and only a few of them become profitable. It is important for
           developers to be able to predict the success of their app and incorporate features which makes an app
           successful. Before any such predictive-study can be done, it is necessary to do EDA and data-preprocessing on
           the apps data available for google app store applications. From the collected apps data and user ratings from
           the app stores, let's try to extract insightful information.
- Objective:
  -  The Goal is to explore the data and pre-process it for future use in any predictive analytics study.
- Data set Information:
  -  Web scraped data of 10k Play Store apps for analyzing the Android market. Each app (row) has values for
     category, rating, size, and more.

## Project - 2
## Data Visualization on Honey Production dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.
### Domain: Food and agriculture

- Context: In 2006, a global concern was raised over the rapid decline in the honeybee population, an integral component
           to American honey agriculture. Large numbers of hives were lost to “Colony-Collapse-Disorder”, a
           phenomenon of disappearing “worker-bees” causing the remaining “hive-colony” to collapse. Speculation
           around the cause of this disorder points to hive-diseases and pesticides harming the pollinators, though no
           overall consensus has been reached. Twelve years later, some industries are observing recovery but the
           American honey industry is still largely struggling. The U.S. used to locally produce over half the honey it
           consumes per year. Now, honey mostly comes from overseas, with 350 of the 400 million pounds of honey
           consumed every year originating from imports. This dataset provides insight into honey production supply and
           demand in America by state from 1998 to 2012.


- Objective:
  - The Goal is to use Python visualization libraries such as seaborn and matplotlib to investigate the data and get
some useful conclusions.
