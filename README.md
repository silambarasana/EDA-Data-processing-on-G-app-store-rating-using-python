## Project 1
## EDA on YouTube data using Python 3
- Domain: Social media
### Domain: Social media
- Context and Content: In a fairly recent move by Youtube, it announced the decision to hide the
                       number of dislikes from users around November 2021. However, the official YouTube Data API allowed you to
                       get information about dislikes until December 13, 2021. Doing an EDA-exercise can help to draw some unseen
                       insights from this dataset.
- Learning Outcome:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas.
- Objective:
  - To do data analysis and explore the youtube dislikes dataset using numpy and pandas libraries and drive
  - To do data analysis and explore the youtube dislikes dataset using NumPy and Pandas libraries and drive
    meaningful insights by performing Exploratory data analysis.
- Data Description:
YouTube Dislikes Dataset:
- This dataset contains information about trending YouTube videos from August 2020 to December 2021
- for the USA, Canada, and Great Britain.
- This dataset contains the latest possible information about dislikes,likes,views and more which was
- This dataset contains the latest possible information about dislikes, likes, views and more which was
  collected just before December 13. The information was collected by videos that had been trending in
  the USA, Canada, and Great Britain for a year prior.

##  Project -2
##  EDA & Data Preprocessing on Google App Store Rating Dataset.
### Domain: Mobile device apps
- Context: The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. However, many
           apps are being developed every single day and only a few of them become profitable. It is important for
           developers to be able to predict the success of their app and incorporate features which makes an app
           successful. Before any such predictive-study can be done, it is necessary to do EDA and data-preprocessing on
           the apps data available for google app store applications. From the collected apps data and user ratings from
           the app stores, let's try to extract insightful information.
- Objective:
            The Goal is to explore the data and pre-process it for future use in any predictive analytics study.
- Data set Information:
            Web scraped data of 10k Play Store apps for analyzing the Android market. Each app (row) has values for
            category, rating, size, and more.
