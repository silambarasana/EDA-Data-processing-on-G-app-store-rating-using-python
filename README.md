apps are being developed every single day and only a few of them become profitable. It is important for
developers to be able to predict the success of their app and incorporate features which makes an app
successful. Before any such predictive-study can be done, it is necessary to do EDA and data-preprocessing on
the apps data available for google app store applications. From the collected apps data and user ratings from
the app stores, let's try to extract insightful information.
